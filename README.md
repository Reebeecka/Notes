<h3>Created noteApp to make new notes and edit old ones with a MySql database. </h3>
<h4>In the repo I have included a sample sql file. Just import that file in your database to get started. <h4>

<p>There is a user to test with: <br>
Username: test <br> password: test <br>
But you can also create your own user if you want with the create user button. </p>

<p>To start the project clone the repo to you computer then go into you database to check your connectionport. Project is set up to port 3306. If you have a different port then change the port in app.js on row 17. </p>

<p>After that you can in backend folder run npm install. 
This will install express, cors, morgan, mySql2.</p>

<p>Then you can install backend with nmp start. <em>(IMPORTANT to do this before you start the frontEnd. Otherwise it will not work.)</em><p>

<p>When the backend is running go to your frontEnd folder and run nmp install. </p>
<p>This will install react, react-router-dom, axios and tinymce. </p>
<p>Then you can run the command npm start.</p>
<p>You will be prompted to change server from 3000 if the backend is already running. <em>Press yes.</em></p>
<h4>Now the application will work.</h4>
